# Fancy LED library and controllers for the LED floor

This was supposed to be an implementation of [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) for the LED floor, but it seems to be becoming more of a library to do fancy stuff with the LED floor.

To use OSC commands (e.g. from Sonic Pi) with the floor, [PyOSC](https://github.com/IanShelanskey/pyosc) needs to be installed.
Tutorial [here](https://ianshelanskey.com/2014/08/11/raspberry-pi-and-osc-part-1/d). In  a nutshell:

- navigate to the /lib/pyosc folder
- chmod + x ./setup.py
- sudo ./setup.py install
